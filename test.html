<h1>JavaScript Dates</h1>
<h2>The getDate() Method</h2>

<p>getDate() returns the day of the month (from 1 to 31) of a date:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let gM = new Date.getMonth();
let gFY = new Date.getFullYear();
let calSet = gFY +"-"+ gM + 1 + "01";
console.log(calSet);
let startDay = getDay(calSet);
let conDay =  days.startDay;
console.log(conDay);
</script>

<!-- NOTES
Box IDs
Day of week
Iterate dates starting with correct starting day

1. Set a date with the first of the current month
2. Identify the DoW of the 1st
3. Make the corresponding box ID the first entry
4. Loop the rest of the dates in order

1. getMonth()
2. getFullYear()
3. concat year/month/1st into a string that matches proper format
4. getDay() of the date string
5. Convert the day so that Sunday is box 0
6. Create a loop that numbers each box openly, but links full date to each box
    a. x = 
    a. Friday would go from 4 to 5, so --for (let i = 0; i < x; i++)
